This is a group project assignment from unit ICT 289 computer graphics principles and programming. We are creating from scratch this game, using the language C and OpenGl to deal with the graphics translations, rendering, etc. 
We draw the three main objects to be displayed on the game (Table, Strikers and the Puck) with a program called Blender. We imported it into our program by reading a .obj file containing thousands of coordinates to form the objects, and with OpenGL library, we coded to read these coordinates and display them.
At current, we are implementing the physics of the game. Basically, we will code the movements of the strikers with the arrow keys and the puck movement based on how the pucks hit it. Once the player hit the disc and score a goal, the ball restarts its movement.
